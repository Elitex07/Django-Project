Our Aim|
Our Aim is to make the Gas Agency system more efficient by providing it to end user for self service. You can use this service without any restriction (Terms and Conditions Apply) if you have internet connection. You can take a new connection. book a gas, check the deliveries etc. Now no more waiting in line if you are also an introvert like me ;).|

What We Used?|
We have used the powerful framework Django which makes it easier for developers to use HTML, CSS and Python simultaneously for frontend and backend. But why only Django? Its because using Django one can easily make a local server. We also hosted our server on replit. No matter wherever you are you can use it. Our server works fast as sonic the hedgehog with the response time of 30ms.|
